# Project Title: Distracted Driver Detection

- Aim:
The aim of this project is to develop a system that can detect distracted driving behavior using machine learning techniques. By analyzing images or video frames from a vehicle's camera, the system can classify whether a driver is engaged in activities that could lead to distraction, such as texting, talking on the phone, eating, or not paying attention to the road.

## Distracted driver detection using VGG16 involves several key features:

-> Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture: VGG16 is a deep CNN architecture that consists of 16 layers, primarily comprised of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. This architecture is adept at extracting hierarchical features from images, making it suitable for complex tasks like driver distraction detection. -> Pre-trained Weights: VGG16 is often utilized with pre-trained weights on large image datasets like ImageNet. This allows the model to leverage learned features from diverse images, enhancing its ability to generalize to new tasks such as distracted driver detection. -> Feature Extraction: VGG16 excels at extracting low to high-level features from images. In the context of distracted driver detection, these features might include facial expressions, hand gestures, and other indicators of distraction such as phone usage or eating. -> Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning involves adapting the pre-trained VGG16 model to the specific task of distracted driver detection by updating its weights on a smaller dataset of driver images labeled with distraction classes. This process allows the model to learn task-specific features while retaining the general knowledge gained from the pre-trained weights. -> Classification: Once the features are extracted, a classification layer is added to the VGG16 architecture to classify images into different distraction categories (e.g., texting, eating, adjusting the radio). This classification layer is typically a fully connected layer followed by a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class.

Conclusion: By leveraging these key features, distracted driver detection using VGG16 can effectively identify and classify various forms of driver distraction, contributing to improved road safety.
